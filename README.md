# Mini-Wonders in 3D: Promoting craftsmanship from around the world
Somebody once said that "the sculpture is a music, frozen in stone". However, 3D art should not be static!!

Where possible, I'll try to embed relevant sounds into my animation shots, and publish them on YouTube. Enjoy :-)

## Japan - Katana
As described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_swordsmithing), the forging of a Japanese blade would typically take several weeks and was considered a sacred art, traditionally accompanied by the Shinto religious rituals. As with many complex endeavors, several artists were involved: a smith to forge the rough shape, often a second smith (apprentice) to fold the metal, a specialist polisher, and even a specialist for the edge. Often, there were sheath, hilt, and handguard specialists as well.

## Ireland - Jack-o'-lantern
Nowadays we carve Jack-o’-lantern around the world at Halloween. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack-o%27-lantern), this tradition originated in Ireland and the name itself is linked to the local legend about Stinky Jack, who bargained with Devil and is doomed now to roam the Earth with only a hollowed turnip to light his way. It’s believed that the carved lanterns (made of turnips, pumpkins, etc) help to ward off evil spiris.
