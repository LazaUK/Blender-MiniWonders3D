# Mini-Wonders in 3D: Promoting craftsmanship from around the world
Somebody once said that "the sculpture is a music, frozen in stone". However, 3D art should not be static!!

Where possible, I'll try to embed relevant sounds into my animation shots, and publish them on YouTube. Enjoy :-)

## Japan - Katana
As described on Wikipedia, the forging of a Japanese blade would typically take several weeks and was considered a sacred art, traditionally accompanied by the Shinto religious rituals. As with many complex endeavors, several artists were involved: a smith to forge the rough shape, often a second smith (apprentice) to fold the metal, a specialist polisher, and even a specialist for the edge. Often, there were sheath, hilt, and handguard specialists as well.
